This is my personal website, it will involve blogs and updates along my coding journey. In the Fall of 2021 I took a 
datastructures class in C++, it was my first geniune coding class I had. To expand my horizons, in the winter of 2021-2022
I have decided to start learning more code stuff and more ways to utilize them. Computer Science is the most powerful tool 
that we currently have (as of 2022), and as such I find it incredibly useful to potentially learn.
